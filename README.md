PIC10C Assignment 1 - familiarizing with version control

Wanted to learn/explore how trading strategy algorithms and programming can create a (successful?) financial trading bot. 
Currently following DataCamp's [tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/finance-python-trading) and [Quantopian](https://www.quantopian.com/tutorials/getting-started#lesson2) as resources to get started implementing this in Python.
